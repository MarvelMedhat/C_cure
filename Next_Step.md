# Next Steps

## How to run the code?
1. Install the required packages

2. Put datasets in C_cure folder (if you downloaded datasets from drive , you maybe will need to change dataset filename)

3. Run the Main.py file

## What did we do?
- Preprocessed the dataset.

- Split the dataset into 3 subsets.

## What do we need to do?
We need to test the following models: [[Deepseek](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct),[Qwen 2.5 coder](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct),[Devstral](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Devstral-Small-2507-GGUF)]

## Notes
- **Link Kaggle to VSCode**: You need to connect the Kaggle server (GPU) to VSCode.

- **Data Shuffling**: Ensure you shuffle the dataset before using it.

- **Model Selection**: If you find that a model is unsuitable for the task, feel free to try other models. However, ensure that Kaggle's hardware is capable of running any model you choose.
